Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CPO at Corellium â€” a virtual hardware platform for government agencies and large enterprises to perform security research, penetration testing and development on mobile and IoT devices. I run the product management, customer support and design teams.

Previously I ran an agency called Jellypepper. We worked with startups in self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery, cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics. Jellypepper was acquired in 2023 by Raw Studio, where I joined them as an Advisor.

I have limited availability and occasionally take on freelance projects and consulting. I'm also open to joining boards and advisory roles. If you're interested, please get in touch.

Also, I have a [private mailing list](https://www.haydenbleasel.com/mailing-list) where I keep 1000+ people up to date with what I'm working on. Feel free to join if you're interested.
